Next Gen DevOps Transformation Framework

##What is it?

The Next Gen DevOps Transformation Framework provides organisations with a structured approach to a DevOps or SRE transition.

The framework is presented so that anyone reading it can understand the nature and complexity of a transition to DevOps or further on to SRE. It also allows organisations to choose which challenge to tackle first. Each project has been structured to provide clear benefits. In addition to this the framework presents further capabilities that can be made available to an organisation with a little extra work by combining the capabilities delivered by multiple projects.

The framework is presented as a series of tables to ensure the reader understands the flow from one capability level to the next. While this makes editing the individual markdown documents less convenient it was decided as a necessary compromise to ensure the projects goals were met.

[For additional context please read my blog entry announcing the framework](http://nextgendevops.com/2015/04/07/whats-next-for-next-gen-devops/)

If more information is needed the book Next Gen DevOps: Creating The DevOps Organisation by Grant Smith presents all the essential background and research. Search Amazon for Next Gen DevOps.

##The Latest Version

The latest version of the Next Gen DevOps Transformation Framework is comprised of 13 artefacts including this readme.

**3rd_party_component_management.md** is a markdown document that describes a series of increasingly mature approaches to managing the many 3rd party components used in modern online service provision.

**LICENSE** is a plain text version of the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal license the Next Gen DevOps Framework is published under. A nicely formated version of which is available here: [http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode)

**README.md** is this document

**budgets.md** is a markdown document that describes a series of increasingly capable approaches to budgeting for building and managing evolving online services.

**build_and_interation.md** is a markdown document that describes a series of increasingly capable approaches to the automated build and deployment activities necessary to build and manage evolving online services.

**capability_web.png** is an optimised Portable Network Graphics image that attempts to display the network of capabilities at all stages of maturity that make up the Next Gen DevOps Framework.

**capability_web_with_benefits.png** is an optimised Portable Network Graphics image that attempts to display the network of capabilities at all stages of maturity that make up the Next Gen DevOps Framework. This version of the diagram suggests some of the additional benefits that can be made available once multiple projects have been completed. The list is not intended to be exhaustive merely indicative and none of them are *those* sort of benefits.

**change_management.md** is a markdown document that describes a series of increasingly capable approaches to managing how evolving online services change over time. The projects specified within are designed to mature an organisation's approach to changing online services while supporting an ITIL approach to change management.

**feedback_loops.md** is a markdown document that describes a series of increasingly capable approaches to monitoring real-time and near real-time system, service data and the business performance of online services.

**incident_management.md** is a markdown document that describes a series of increasingly capable approaches to managing the incidents that occur when building, launching and managing evolving online services. The projects specified within have been created to allow an organisation to use follow ITIL's incident management methods within a product-centric team. In otherwords this framework does not support the creation of consolidated service management teams handling incidents from multiple services simultaneously.

**project_management.md** is a markdown document that describes a series of increasingly capable approaches to managing all of the projects necessary to build, launch and manage evolving online services.

**service_engineering.md** is a markdown document that describes a series of increasingly capable approaches to using the skills and experience of specialist software engineers to improve how an organisation's ability to engineer online services.

**test_engineering.md** is a markdown document that descibes a series of increasingly capable approaches an organisation can take that improves the quality and performance of the online services they build and manage.

##Documentation

It is anticipated that this readme combined with the framework itself is sufficient documentation and so it is replicated on the wiki:
[https://github.com/grjsmith/NGDO-Transformation-Framework/wiki](https://github.com/grjsmith/NGDO-Transformation-Framework/wiki)
However should additional documentation be required that doesn't sit well within the framework or this readme it will be provided seperately in the wiki and this section of the readme will be updated accordingly.


##How to use the framework

1. Assess the organisation or project's current capability levels by reviewing the observed behaviours described at each capability level. By matching the description to behaviours observed in the organisation a level can be determined.
2. Repeat this process across all the capabilities. This will provide an indication of which projects will provide the most value.
3. Once it's been decided which capability needs to improve create a project or projects to deliver the scope described in the relevant project scope section. Once the additional capabilities have been determined reassess the capability and iterate until the observed behaviours in the organisation match those described in the next level.
4. Rinse and repeat
