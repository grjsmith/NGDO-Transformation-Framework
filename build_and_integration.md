#Build & Integration

| Capability Level | Capability Name | Description | Observed Behaviour | Project Scope |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|0|Build & Integration: Ad hoc|Continuous build ad hoc and sporadically successful.|Only revenue generating applications are subject to automated build and test.<br>**Automated builds fail frequently.**<br>No clear ownership of build system capability, reliability and performance.<br>**No clear ownership of 3rd-party components.**<br>|Create a process for integrating new 3rd party components, including a security assessment.<br>**Give one group clear ownership and budget for the performance, capability and reliability of the build system.**<br>Create an infrastructure security model and implement it by deploying each instance in appropriate security groups, access control lists and firewall rules.<br>**Choose between immutable infrastructure and patching. Choose between agent based configuration management or the push model. Ensure the security model is amended as required.**|
|1|Build & Integration: Continuous Build|Continuous build is reliable for revenue generating applications.|Automated build and test activities are reliable in the build environment.<br>**Deployment of applications to production environment is unreliable.**<br>Software and test engineers concerned that system configuration is the root cause.|Add environment tests to automated test system to be executed in the build environment, add similar tests to the monitoring service to validate essential configuration elements match.<br>**Resolve all failing tests with Configuration Management system ensuring all configuration artefacts (config files, reference data etc.) are in source control.**<br>Add system build and configuration tasks to build system.<br>**Ensure all engineers understand why configuration elements vary between systems and environments.**<br>If immutable infrastructure or push based configuration management was chosen create an infrastructure refresh process that will be used to replace infrastructure when vulnerabilities are discovered.|
|2|Build & Integration: Continuous deployment|Continuous deployment of individual services is reliable for all products, services and tools.|Configuration for systems, virtual machines and containers can be deployed without human intervention.<br>**A minimum level of automated testing is in place to confirm applications deployed and display minimal viable functionality**<br>Service changes can only be deployed individually and core functionality changes require staff from many departments to leave their teams to participate in war-rooms|Add dependency management and discovery to configuration management and deployment systems<br>**Create mocks for 3rd party dependencies that don’t provide test mechanisms**<br>Add more sophisticated automated tests to assure core service functions operate as expected, including testing access controls from within each security group to and from the other security groups.<br>**Implement key store and rotation mechanism for all system and interactive access**|
|3|Build & Integration: Continuous Service Integration|Continuous deployment of all services and the management of all their dependencies is reliable.|Automated service tests are in place to validate the function of the service as an integrated whole.<br>**Significant service wide changes make the organisation nervous and they demand onerous manual oversight of such changes.**|Develop the capability to deploy service changes to groups of customers in specific geographic regions or to percentages of customer base.<br>**Create feature toggles for all new features or significant changes to features allowing code to be deployed at all times regardless of it’s state of completion.**|
|4|Build & Integration: Continuous Delivery|Continuous deployment of all services is reliable.|All code can be deployed at any time to any group of customers as desired.<br>**Automated testing ensures test engineers can focus on UX and exploratory testing.**|-|
