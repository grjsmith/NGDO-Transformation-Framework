#Change Management
| Capability Level | Capability Name | Description | Observed Behaviour | Project Scope |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|0|Change Management: Basic|Change management process relies on review and sign-off by external teams.|Few standard deployment techniques.<br>**Changes are signed off by people lacking appropriate context and knowledge so all changes require a lengthy review process and more testing than necessary.**<br>Application roll-outs are scripted but database and system changes are manual or if automated only by simple for-next loops.<br>**Database changes often require downtime this a constant factor in design decisions.**|Analyse recent changes. Group changes whose roll-out requires standard tasks.<br>**Invest in roll-out processes and pre-approval mechanisms for the most common types of changes.**<br>Create service health criteria that, once met, define a successful change, including validating the state of the security implementation.<br>**Begin recording change related metrics such as time from build completion to change rollout.**<br>Raise tickets for each deployment failure, treat them as incidents with all the necessary categorisation codes.|
|1|Change Management: Pre-agreed Changes|Common low-risk changes are pre-signed off as long as the change activity itself is auditable.|Pace of change accelerates.<br>**Standard changes automated as a result less change related incidents occur.**<br>Misclassified changes whose roll-outs create incidents or outages increase mistrust between software, test, operations engineers and leadership.|Create tiger teams of engineers to be responsible for the roll-out mechanisms, service tests and the deployment activities, include security representatives.<br>**Use a method like BDD to design the deployment mechanisms and service checks and share the evolution of these with the entire organisation**<br>Publish deployment, security, and service health standards so teams creating changes understand how their changes will be deployed, tested and judged.<br>**Enlarge the scope of pre-approved changes to the next most common group of changes.**|
|2|Change Management: Shared Responsibility|Small cross-functional war rooms formed for each change|Engineers from ++all++ disciplines work together to design changes and support the deployment mechanisms.<br>**Deployment systems gradually increase in sophistication until all simple changes are fully automated further speeding up the rate of change and improving reliability.**<br>Legacy systems, data processing systems and, external dependencies are now the major source of change related incidents.|Either create changes with cross-functional teams ensuring all teams have the resources they need to build, launch, manage and support changes on their own or focus on a programme of API building so teams can call upon infrastructure, security and data management services in order to build, launch, manage and support their services.<br>**Create mocks for 3rd party dependencies that don’t provide test mechanisms.**|
|3|Change Management: Cross-functional|Development, test and support is a cross-functional activity or uses sophisticated tools with standardised interfaces (APIs).|Teams have all the necess	ary skills they need to develop, deploy and support all changes.<br>**All deploys are fully automated.**<br>Real-time feedback from changes becomes the new priority.|Using change success and failure data coupled with the increased rate of changes create a process allowing service owners to mandate the changes that require formal approval processes.<br>**Develop the capability to deploy service changes to groups of customers in specific geographic regions or to percentages of the customer base.**<br>Create feature toggles for all new features or significant changes to features allowing code to be deployed at all times regardless of it’s state of completion.|
|4|Change Management: Continuous Delivery|Fully auditable continuous delivery.|Code constantly deployed with feature toggles.<br>**Deployment mechanism provides sophisticated audit features ensuring all changes are ascribed to properly authorised people.**| |
