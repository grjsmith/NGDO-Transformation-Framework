#Feedback Loops

| Capability Level | Capability Name | Description | Observed Behaviour | Project Scope |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|0|Feedback Loops: System Metrics|Service function and performance is inferred from measurement of system metrics|Services are monitored at the system and container level not from within the service itself.<br>**Services log errors to files which are at best partially parsed checking only for known errors.**<br>Service failures are commonly reported by users before they are captured by the monitoring system.|Create custom metrics that describe service health by combining available business and technical metrics.<br>**Analyse all available data from logs, database entries and system events looking for correlations that confirm actual behaviour of the service and itâ€™s users. Monitor this data and iterate alerting thresholds, include interactive and system login data.**<br>Ship all system logs and metrics to more secure data structures.|
|1|Feedback Loops: Correlated Metrics|Core service functionality is monitored indirectly.|A variety of business and system metrics from multiple sources offer some assurance of service function.<br>**More service failures are captured by the monitoring system than the users but triage frequently takes longer than mitigation.**|Invest development time in capturing key service events and their performance in real-time. Record these events and the performance data in searchable object stores. Aggregate the data and add suitable thresholds in the alerting system.<br>**Ship security events like new user creation, login events, credential updates and key rotation to more secure data structures**.|
|2|Feedback Loops: Service & System|Core service functionality and performance is monitored directly.|The service records functionality checkpoints and performance metrics in a high-performance store making simple correlations and presentation of data trivial.<br>**Senior leadership and non-operations people still feel abstracted from the service and user experience.**|Correlate service data with obfuscated customer and transaction data and present it on dashboards.<br>**Build more sophisticated monitoring and alerting thresholds based on this new customer centric data such as alerting by geography, ISP, or  CRM data.**<br>Implement a SIEM to process the security data.|
|3|Feedback Loops: Service & Business|Service function and performance is monitored using custom metrics that are valuable and meaningful to everyone in the business.|Real-time system, service and business metrics are collected and presented alongside important correlations. Data is trended and compared to historical events allowing models to be created that predict future behaviour.<br>**Incidents relating to new features and changes outnumber all other incidents combined.**|Include operations and test engineers in the development of new features give them the responsibility for the performance and reliability of new features during the development phase.<br>**Build or buy a service to search hacker sites looking for evidence of known vulnerabilities, attempts to organise hacks or evidence that a hack has been successful.**|
|4|Feedback Loops: continuous Improvement|Features and monitoring advance in lockstep.|The monitoring and alerting of new service capabilities are built and tested alongside the new features themselves.|-|
