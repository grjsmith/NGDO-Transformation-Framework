#Incident Management

| Capability Level | Capability Name | Description | Observed Behaviour | Project Scope |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|0|Incident Management: Incident Handling|Incident management only performed by support teams|Change and deployment related incidents are common and frequently repeated.<br>**User community identify incidents faster than the monitoring system.**<br>Incidents compete with new feature development and deployments when additional expertise is needed.<br>**Incident management and communications is regarded as less important than new feature development.**|Formalise the criteria that defines a healthy service, including security strength.<br>**Record and report on the reasons for each incident.**<br>Create incident cost metrics so that incident resolution can be prioritised alongside new feature development.<br>**Allocate a percentage of software engineering and other SMEs time each week to incident management.**<br>Encourage staff managing incidents to create stories or use cases for the resolution of repeat incidents.<br>**Introduce ChatOps. Create chat groups with relevant engineers and other SMEs to support major changes and incidents.**|
|1|Incident Management: Allocated Time|A percentage of Development time, each sprint, allocated to support tasks.|Engineers from different disciplines begin collaborating on investigations.<br>**Development teams begin to learn how services behave in production.**<br>Change and deployment incidents diminish and there are less repeat incidents.<br>**Insufficient data analysis for root cause analysis.**|Ensure mitigation and resolution are separate sections in incident communications.<br>**When permanent resolution requires development work have the relevant resource manager write the resolution response.**<br>Create a process that facilitates operations and test engineers contribution to software engineering priorities.<br>**Assign some of the software engineers who contributed to the latest build to a support role supporting the deployment and the application in live for  a short time.**<br>Create a seperate security incident management process and assign a group responsible for handling security incidents, have this group run frequent (weekly) wargames.|
|2|Incident Management: Shared Responsibility|Development teams switch to a support footing immediately after a release.|Root cause analysis matures and hypotheses are formed and tested.<br>**Focus begins to shift to performance related incidents and single user faults.**<br>Incident communications can now come from the resolving team regardless of whether thatâ€™s an operational, support, or development team.<br>**Response to incidents caused by external events is poor.**|Trend service specific metrics and create alerting thresholds.<br>**Display service metrics on dashboards visible to all staff add real world events such as extreme weather and other major news events, analyse for patterns and correlations.**<br>Develop a process for escalating repeat incidents or strategic problems to senior leadership so that they receive the same attention as business cases.<br>**Choose either an API/Self-service strategy or adopt a cross-functional strategy to develop applications and services, teams should have all the skills and experiences they need to build, launch and support services.**|
|3|Incident Management: End-to-end|Incident management is a cross-functional activity|Incident data is analysed for patterns.<br>**Incident communication is managed by the team that owns the service.**<br>Incident notification is now fully automated, subsequent communications are managed by the service owning team.<br>**Stories defining permanent resolutions now receive high priority at sprint planning as incidents directly impede progress.**<br>External events still cause outages.|Develop functionality and performance monitors alongside new features.<br>**Using either cross-functional teams or the service and infrastructure APIs develop self-mitigation mechanisms such as auto-scaling and automated failover.**<br>Develop mechanisms to simulate or cause component failures to test fault tolerance and business continuity and execute these regularly.,<br>**Implement a SIEM to process or security events, create simulations for common or expected attacks.**|
|4|Incident Management: Prevention|Product teams are cross-functional|Product teams use data analysis to understand their service, their customers and their operating environments to such an extent that they can predict when incidents are likely to occur and can prevent them having an impact by building a truly fault tolerant service.<br>**Security are aware of attacks in advance and are able to prepare network and hosting services to repell the attack.**<br>Live service failures are initiated purposely to demonstrate resilience and learn about weaknesses in the service.|-|
