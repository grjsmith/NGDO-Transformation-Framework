#Software Engineering
| Capability Level | Capability Name | Description | Observed Behaviour | Project Scope |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|0|Software Engineering: Minimum viable Capability|Application Development  team define their own standards.|Application Development have accepted internal standards and guidelines but not shared them.<br>**Security, test, and operations capability are not considered necessary for new feature development.**<br>There is little-to-no trust between software, operations and test engineers as teams don’t understand or value each other’s domains, expertise, experience or contribution.|Codify development standards, include language choices, style guides, code review processes as well as IDE, LINT, security review and other tool choices.<br> Apply these standards to operations and test code.<br>**Apply development standards to existing operational scripts and automated tests and store all operations and test code in the source control repository no matter how bad it is.**<br>Initiate code reviews for operations and test code.|
|1|Software Engineering: Universal Standards|Technology standards are shared across the the whole technology organisation.|All engineers use the same tools and adhere to the same standards, trust grows between engineers.<br>**Software and test engineers don’t understand or trust the environments.**<br>Operations and test engineers still excluded from application development.<br>**Engineers lack understanding of test coverage and quality.**|Apply coding standards to configuration management elements.<br>Perform code reviews on configuration management and deployment code. Rotate the duty among several software engineers.<br>**Have software and operations engineers work with test engineers to contribute automated tests for application and environment build and deployment activities.**|
|2|Software Engineering: Peer Review|All engineers contribute to improving quality and standards.|Informal collaboration and pairing will begin with small projects.<br>**Operations and test engineers still take an ad hoc approach to software development.**|Include operations and test engineers in software design and planning activities.<br>**Test engineers should be tasked with designing and coding the tests for all new features.**<br>Operations engineers should be tasked with assessing the impact of new features on infrastructure and updating configuration and deployment mechanisms<br>**Run security coding Dojos for all engineers.**|
|3|Software Engineering: Collaborative Design and Development|New feature development is collaborative and standards subject to continuous improvement.|New features receive improved testing and suffer no regression bugs.<br>**New features provide high quality feedback and suffer less performance and capacity problems.**<br>Significant effort is still required to build, test, deploy and support changes to core components.|Develop the capability to deploy service changes to groups of customers in specific geographic regions or to percentages of the customer base.<br>**Create feature toggles for all new features or significant changes to features allowing code to be deployed at all times regardless of it’s state of completion.**|
|4|Service Engineering: Continuous Delivery|Feature toggles, targeted and partial deployments normal|New features can be deployed before they are ready, in an offline state.<br>**Launch of new features is now a configuration task not a deployment task.**<br>Enabling and disabling features does not cause incidents as the service is fault tolerant.|-|
