#Test Engineering

| Capability Level | Capability Name | Description | Observed Behaviour | Project Scope |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|0|Test Engineering: Manual Testing|All tests are manual except for unit tests.|Testers follow checklists but only test revenue generating services on environments whose configuration they donâ€™t understand.<br>**Release cycles get longer as new features require more testing.**<br>Regression bugs are common.|Formalise and publish a coherent test approach to be reviewed by all engineers.<br>**Choose an automated test mechanism and framework that supports a human readable domain specific language (DSL).**<br>Code the steps necessary to allow simple user interaction functionality (such as form submission and check status type actions) to be tested at build time.<br>**Provide training to testers enabling them to write automated using the DSL.**|
|1|Test Engineering: Coherent Test Approach|Simple functions have rudimentary automated tests executed at build time.|All apps and services are now tested with a common approach.<br>**Basic service function is tested with automated tests at build time.**<br>Regression bugs are less common and the test cycle has been shortened but it keeps growing as new features are added.|Have test engineers create user stories or use cases for the test steps needed to automate more of the standard tests.<br>**Involve test engineers in use case (or user story) creation to ensure new feature use cases or user stories have appropriate test steps specified or tests created.**<br>Involve security analysts in testing application and infrastructure security, including penetration tests.|
|2|Test Engineering: Basic Automation|Basic steps coded for automated tests|Basic steps that can be combined to form complex test cases are coded and so all core service functionality can be tested.<br>**Manual testing is still required prior to release.**|Develop test steps and tests alongside new features.<br>**Focus test engineers on UX and ensuring all major user activities are tested at build time with automated tests.**<br>Create automated tests to check that mistakes made in configuration management and compromises made in the integration environments haven't broken the security model in production.|
|3|Test Engineering: Automated testing|Automated user story or use case testing|Automated tests exist for all user stories and use cases.<br>**Manual checks are no longer required to ensure core service functionality.**<br>Test engineers focus their time on exploratory testing and improving the sophistication of the test systems.|Add a performance component to tests report changes in service performance at build time and in each environment.<br>**Have test and security engineers code tests for all bugs found during exploratory testing.**<br>Integrate security tests such as penetrations tests, software vulnerability scans, and container and artefact inspection.|
|4|Test Engineering: Continuous Delivery|Tests developed alongside new features.|Regression bugs now impossible.<br>**New feature test cases and security checks are developed alongside new features.**|- |
